title: The Basics of Tensorflow
---

This post is meant to get you up to speed with Tensorflow. It's by far one of the most popular languages for creating neural networks and regression models, so if you're interested in AI or machine learning, you should definitely be familiar with it. I realize the temptation to just start using frameworks like Keras before understanding how Tensorflow works. However, I implore you to dive into the deeper levels of this library, as it will make your knowledge of machine learning exponentially more valuable and marketable.

## But what *is* Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is a **graph-based computational library**. This means that when it calculates `3 + 4`, it's actually calculating the sum using two nodes with the values of `3` and `4` in them
