## The Devnagari script

The writing system that modern Hindi uses is called the Devnagari script. It is an _abugida_, which means that consonants and vowels aren't written like an alphabet (such as English, Spanish, Russian, etc.). Instead, vowels are written as **augmentations** on consonants to form _syllabic units_. This is also why abugidas are sometimes called _alphasyllabaries_.

The Devnagari (sometimes written as _Dev**a**nagari_) script is the one that Sanskrit also used back in its heyday. Due to this, it has ancient roots that go way back to all important North Indian texts.

### How it is written

The first thing that you need to learn to analyze when writing Hindi is the construction of syllabic units. These are **not** the same thing as syllables. Instead, syllabic units are the way that we break consonants and their vowel augmentations down into an order that can be replicated in writing.
