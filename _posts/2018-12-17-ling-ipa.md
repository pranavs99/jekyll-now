# What is it?

The International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA for short, is how linguists represent every known sound in every language that has been studied. As you can tell from the title, the IPA is an _alphabet_, so vowels and consonants are both represented using symbols that we call letters. The IPA uses letters that are based on existing Indo-European letters, mostly borrowing from the Latin alphabet and occasionally from Greek and other alphabets.

So why not just use the Latin alphabet entirely? This has to do with the irregularities of the Latin alphabet: for example, the word _**sh**ut_ contains a "sh" sound, which is quite odd because it's a single sound made by two separate letters (each of which has its own distinct sound). To avoid disambiguation, the IPA just created a separate sound for the letter: Êƒ. There's actually a lot of reasons that the IPA chose to avoid certain Latin alphabet irregularities, which I'll probably address in a future post (one example is the same letter, c, making two different sounds in _cat_ and _cello_).
