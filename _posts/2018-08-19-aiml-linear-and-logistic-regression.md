title: Linear and logistic regression
---

In this post, we're going to look at the absolute backbone of machine learning: regression. We'll start off with explaining both linear and logistic regression separately, and then we'll compare and contrast them.

## What is regression?

Regression is the act of deducing a trend from a series of data points. In most introductory statistics courses, you're given a Cartesian plane with a lot of points on it, usually in some sort of discernable pattern. In Figure 1 below, you can see that there's a somewhat downsloping trend going on.
