My name is Pranav Singh. I'm a second-year Linguistics and Computer Science student at UCLA, and I'm extremely lucky and privileged to be where I am today.

I originally came in as an astrophysics major, but after my terrible first quarter physics class (and a lot of panicked pacing back and forth and reconsideration of life), I decided to switch into a safer field, computer science. However, I didn't want to just do that: I found a combination of CS and a field I have loved for a very long time: linguistics.

I'm involved in ACM AI at UCLA, where I attend workshops to hone my AI and ML skills (which you can read about in that tab). If you're looking for another solid resource for learning about AI and ML, I strongly recommend checking out ACM AI President <a href="https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/" target="_blank">Adit's website</a>. I'm also involved in the <a href="http://processing.linguistics.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA Language Processing Lab</a>, where I collect and analyze data for Ph.D students in the department. We also have research groups, where we write papers on and design experiments to test today's most innovative linguistic topics.
Next year, I plan to start my own NLP club called BruinNLP and become an Office of Undergraduate Admission Tour Guide.

In my free time, I love to maintain my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1234704652?si=k6Dt_IgnTeKmHmJrtRzHtg).
