Hello everybody, my name is Pranav Singh and I'm currently a graduating senior from UCLA majoring in Linguistics & Computer Science. So far, I've collected 3 summers' worth of software engineering experience in the fields of data science and cloud engineering and I'm passionate about scalable and sustainable systems, but more importantly, I'm focused on creating and enabling products that generate substantial value for their customers. I'm currently transitioning into the trades of Technical Sales and Product Management and am looking forward to a Product Management internship at New Relic this summer.
